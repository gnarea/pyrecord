PyRecord: Pythonic *Record* Types
=================================

A `record <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)>`_ (aka
"struct" in C) is a pre-defined collection of values where each is accessed
by a unique name. Depending on the nature of the data, records may be a
superior alternative to dictionaries and instances of custom classes.

**PyRecord** allows you to use records in Python v2.7 to v3.x and
PyPy v2, and can be thought of as an improved *namedtuple*.
