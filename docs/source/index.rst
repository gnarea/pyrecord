PyRecord: Record Datatype Implementation for Python
***************************************************

This library allows you to use `records
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)>`_ (aka "structs" in C)
in Python.

A record is a composite datatype with a defined collection of values (each with
a unique name) and no operations. In Python terms, that'd be an instance of a
class for which you don't write methods because you're only intested in using
it to store data. It's like a dictionary, but CONTINUE HERE.
