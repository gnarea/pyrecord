Questions about modelling your own data types should be raised on a channel
like `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/>`_. To ask questions about
PyRecord, report bugs and request features, `use GitHub
<https://github.com/gnarea/pyrecord/issues>`_. 

If you're looking for an example on how to use PyRecord,
`hubspot-contacts <http://pythonhosted.org/hubspot-contacts/>`_ is the first
Free Software project to use this library. It's co-authored by the creator of
this library and could therefore be considered a good example on how to use
records.
