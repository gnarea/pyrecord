# PyRecord: Pythonic *Record* Types

A [record][4] (aka "struct" in C) is a pre-defined collection of values where
each is accessed by a unique name. Depending on the nature of the data, records
may be a superior alternative to dictionaries and instances of custom classes.

**PyRecord** allows you to use records in Python v2.7 to v3.x and PyPy v2,
and can be thought of as an improved *namedtuple*.
