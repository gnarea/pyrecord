# PyRecord: *Record* Datatype Implementation for Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gnarea/pyrecord.png?branch=master)][1]
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gnarea/pyrecord/badge.png)][2]

This library allows you to use [records][4] (aka "structs" in C) in Python.

Only Python v2.7 onwards is officially supported (including v3.x), but it's very
likely that v2.6 will work just fine (by chance).
