# PyRecord: Pythonic *Record* Data Type

A [record][4] (aka "struct" in C) is a data type with a pre-defined collection
of values (each with a unique name) and no operations. Depending on the nature
of the data, a record may be a superior alternative to dictionaries, named
tuples and custom classes.

This library allows you to use records in Python v2.7 through v3.x and PyPy v2.

The documentation is available at [http://pythonhosted.org/pyrecord/]().
